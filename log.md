# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I've read an email from freeCodeCamp and stumble across a challenge called 100 Days Of Code, I decided to join it.

**Thoughts:** I'm a bit curious about the challenge and decided to check it out. Well, turns out it's a great challenge and i think it'll be good if i committed to the challenge. About my learning progress, today i learned Postgre sql and run through the installation and environment setup, i've also learned postgreSQL data types. Turns out it's not so different from MySQL for the query, but i notice that Postgre has another data types like point, line and circle which MySQL doesn't have; 

**Link to work:** it's on my local environment so yeah, no links;

### Day 1: December 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Fixed one of my Discord Bot command, i've also continue my learning progress on Postgresql.

**Thoughts:** I've been working on a discord bot for a while now. So this morning i noticed a bug on one command, it's called covid-country command which returns an information aboutcovid-19 cases in specific country. I had fixed it, but then another bug were surfaced, the requested data for China is not right and data for United States  did not returned at all. After i checked the API request on Postman app, i realized that China and US have a different JSON format. Then i checked the API documentation and i change the api request slug with a proper one. But there's another problem, now it's coming from the API, my former request slug includes Country Code on it json response while the later still had the Country Code key but all of it's value is empty string. I had to do a workaround for that by creating a new function which used to find country code from different api request. I've also changed a section of my code to asynchronous behaviour in order to get the function work properly. Before this moment i don't really care about asynchronous programming since i never put it to good use, but today i feel the power of magic word Async Await, it's damn cool!.

### Day 2: December 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added new fun command to Histobot.

**Thoughts:** Today i created a new command for my discord bot, btw his name is HistoBot. The new command is a |joke command that returns a random joke. I've created the .js file and wrote the main code, i've also updated the command handler, url constant list and help.js command list. But i haven't tested nor debug it yet because my connection is painfully slow. I can't even login to Discord and i can't access my Bot on hosting environment, so i wrote the command on my local environment and certainly going to test it tomorrow. Then i'm going to push the commit to my github repo and finally pull the update on the hosting environment.

### Day 3: December 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Tested the discord joke command.

**Thoughts:** I'm finally able to test my new bot command, and it work without errors. I've also updated the message embed style so it looks simpler. I'm looking forward to add more commands but haven't come up with a decent idea yet, maybe i'll work on another project for a while. Today i've also helped some friends to solve errors on their postgresql, i'm glad to help but there's one with different problem though. The error seems related to the microsoft account or something, it said "cannot no mapping between accounts and security id was done" when installing postgresql. I've scoured the internet trying to find the answer and haven't found that one solution to crack the egg, maybe i'll try again tomorrow.

### Day 4: December 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Going through some responsive web design challenge on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I decided to go back to the basic, the good ol' html and css. I've planned to finish the Responsive Web Design certifications by January 2021, or faster would be better.

### Day 5: December 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Going through another wave of challenge on FCC.

**Thoughts:** The rate of progress is great, but this is not a 'real' challenge yet. I'm looking forward to start the first responsive project ASAP.

### Day 6: December 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started my 'first' freeCodeCamp responsive web design project.

**Thoughts:** Today i've laid up the groundwork for the project, i wrote all the element that required to pass the test, 8 out of 10 passed. I just have to style it now and make it responsive. I'm going to complete it tomorrow

### Day 7: December 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the tribute page project.

**Thoughts:** A piece of cake, i make a tribute page for Karl Marx with the help of bootstrap. Tomorrow i'll work on the next project!

### Day 8: December 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Survey form project completed, laid a groundwork for the product landing page.

**Thoughts:** A simple html form, not much of a challenge. The biggest problem is only my lazyness to write down all css manually, but ain't that programmer traits? idk. I've plan to finish two project tomorrow, so i can claim the certification at the New Year's Eve. Yeah last certs in 2020!

### Day 9: December 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Built a Metallica album product landing page.

**Thoughts:** Looks simple, maybe i could do more in the future but at least i covers the responsive web design principle for now. Change of plan that i won't finish the certifications by 31st December, there's not enough time and i have another thing to do. So it will be my first cert in 2021!

### Day 10: December 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Going through some CSS Grid challenge before stepping into the fourth project.

**Thoughts:** Got limited coding time so i decided to take some quick challenge. it's 10.32 PM now close to the new year's eve, I spend my time with my family. This is going to be my last commit in 2020, so many good things to reflect.

### Day 11: January 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Working on the fourth project.

**Thoughts:** First day on 2021, a fresh start. I built a technical documentation for my Discord Bot, so after the test passed it'll be useful. I submitted the code with all test passed, but i've just written a half of bot command documentation. I'll write another half tomorrow.

### Day 12: January 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continue working on Bot documentation.

**Thoughts:** Well turns out there still many to write in the documentation and i've also had to re-analyze every command i made so i could build a neat documentation. Just some commands left but i've already bored with it (i dont really like writing things other than code). So i think it'll be good to continue it tomorrow in fresh mood.

### Day 13: January 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finised the documentation and start working on the final project.

**Thoughts:** Finally, the docs is done. Without further delay i uploaded the docs to repl.it so it could be accessed from my bot, i've also updated my bot command to provide the documentation link. Then, i fork the next project on CodePen and write the initial markup before add style and real content to it. Beside that, i've planned something big for special person, hope she's don't read this journal hehe XD.

### Day 14: January 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continue working on project, but delayed because of painfully slow connection.

**Thoughts:** I can't login to GitHub or CodePen, i can't even access font awesome to get some icons. My internet connection is a total junk, but i managed to continue the progress by working on local environment (and it kinda slow because i can't check reference). I write this entry on 4 AM, it's late but better than not write the log at all.

### Day 15: January 5, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Create some animations for portfolio page.

**Thoughts:** 1Mbps can you believe it? Internet connection still slow, can't open library documentation and font-awesome icons. But i managed to check reference from old JavaScript project and implement it to my current project. There's not much to do without stable internet, i hope tomorrow this problem will end. (Btw, today is also a great day for me, i scored 940 in TOEIC and it's the highscore in my school. One shot at glory!)

### Day 16: January 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Still working on the portfolio project.

**Thoughts:** This is really frustrating, the internet connection is getting even slower than before. There's some problem with the test suite and I can't search the forums for explanations 'cause of infinite loading. Eh if i use this shitty internet just for playing game, then fine I don't care. But now this is really delaying my project where it supposed to be completed in 3 days or less.

### Day 17: January 7, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Of course, the portfolio project is not done yet.

**Thoughts:** I think it'll be a good idea to write 2 entry at once since yesterday I can't access GitHub. I must scrapped some of my initial idea like using onscroll animation library for the project because it does not 'compatible' with my layout. Shame that I couldn't search for alternatives, well, you guess it why.

### Day 18: January 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finally, Responsive Web Design project is done.

**Thoughts:** That'll do for today, i spent 5 hours to fix all the layout, styling and responsive problem. It was fun though, i enjoyed it.

### Day 19: January 9, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Working on a surprise project.

**Thoughts:** I'm going to impress her, i'm building something beautiful just for her. It'll be complex, with svg and js libraries. But it's going to be worth it.

### Day 20: January 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Working on a surprise project, add event animations.

**Thoughts:** I mostly make the animation with TimelineMax library, althought there's some loop animation using pure CSS.

### Day 21: January 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Still working on the surprise project, add more complex animations.

**Thoughts:** I added animations for some box and round object, i also added stacking animations.
