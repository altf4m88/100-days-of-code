# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I've read an email from freeCodeCamp and stumble across a challenge called 100 Days Of Code, I decided to join it.

**Thoughts:** I'm a bit curious about the challenge and decided to check it out. Well, turns out it's a great challenge and i think it'll be good if i committed to the challenge. About my learning progress, today i learned Postgre sql and run through the installation and environment setup, i've also learned postgreSQL data types. Turns out it's not so different from MySQL for the query, but i notice that Postgre has another data types like point, line and circle which MySQL doesn't have; 

**Link to work:** it's on my local environment so yeah, no links;
